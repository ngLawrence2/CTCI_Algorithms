1. What is the difference between Memoization and Tabulation?

    - Memoization - This is a top-down approach and uses recursion.
    - Tabulation - This is a bottom-up approach and uses iterative to build a table.

2. Why is memoization helpful?

    - It reduces the need to perform work that has already been done in recursion by saving results in a data structure.
