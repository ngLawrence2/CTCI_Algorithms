1. In which order do the React lifecycle methods(including the optional ones) run?

  -componentWillMount()
  -componentDidMount()
  -componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps)
  -shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)
  -componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState)
  -componentDidUpdate()
  -componentWillUnmount()

2. In which lifecycle methods should you make asynchronous fetches for data?

    -componentDidMount

3. In which lifecycle methods can you call setState?

    - componentDidMount() - will render twice, so setState is not used often here
    - componentDidUpdate() - use with a conditional or there will be an infinite loop
    - componentWillMount() - calling setState synchronously will not trigger an extra render
    - componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) - use setState with comparison of this.props and nextProps to perform state transitions

4. What lifecycle methods get called in the mounting phase? What are the use cases for each of those methods?

  -componentWillMount() and componentDidMount() gets called in the mounting phase
  -componentWillMount() - prepare for the first render. We can handle configuration and update our state.
  -componentDidMount() - interact with Native UI. make changes to our state based on how Native UI laid out content
