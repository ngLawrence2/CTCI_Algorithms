1. What are benefits of a closure?

  - allows a function to access variables from an enclosing scope even after it leaves the scope in which it was declared.
  - allows data encapsulation ( hiding private variables )


2. Formally define a JavaScript closure.

  - A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment from which it was declared.
  - a inner function that has access to the outer(enclosing) function's variables


3. Give an example of a closure.

    function sayHi(name) {
      var msg = `Hi ${name}`;

      function greeting() {
        console.log(msg);
      }

      return greeting;
    }

    var sayHiToJon = sayHi('Jon');
    console.log(sayHiToJon()); // Hi Jon


4. What is data encapsulation?

  - data hiding
  - implementation details are kept hidden from user
  - can be achieved by closures
