1. What is a base case in recursion? Why do we need one? Do we always need one?

    - A base case is a solution that is known in the function and stops the recursion.
    - We always need one for recursion.

2. What exactly is a Stack Overflow?

  - A stack overflow is when there is too many function calls within the call stack and occurs when base case is never reached in recursion.

3. Describe direct and indirect recursion.

  - Direct - The recursive function calls the same function
  - Indirect - A function x that calls another function y and y calls x directly or indirectly
