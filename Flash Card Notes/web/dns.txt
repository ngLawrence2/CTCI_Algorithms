1. Why do we need a DNS?

  - Need to convert human meaningful name(domain name) to a computer meaningful name(IP address)
  - computers can only recognize IP addresses

2. How does a DNS work?

    - Browser queries DNS resolver for a URL
    - DNS queries root servers that has all the data
    - IP address and nameservers are given to the DNS resolver
    - Servers are queried with the result IP address
    - Website files are delivered on the user's page.
