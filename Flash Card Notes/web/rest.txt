1. What are three primary Fielding constraints?

    - Client-Server - network must be made up of clients and servers
    - Stateless - servers and clients do not need to keep track of each other's state
    - uniform interface - common language between servers and clients that allows each part to be swapped out or modified without breaking the system

2. What subcontraints make up a Uniform interface?

    - identification and resources
    - manipulation of resources through representations
    - self-descriptive messages
    - hypermedia

3. Walk through an arbitrary example of a RESTful request/response cycle, and describe what makes it RESTful.

  - An example of a RESTful is a request to an API.
  - When requesting data, the client and server are separated.
  - Client and server does not know each other's state
  - The api sends back JSON data which can be read through the browser on the client's side.

4.  What does it mean to be RESTful?

  -It means that it satisfies Fielding constraints.
  - Client-server
  - Stateless
  - Uniform interface
