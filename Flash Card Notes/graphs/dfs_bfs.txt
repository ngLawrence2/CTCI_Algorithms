1. What are the steps of DFS on a graph?

  - Uses a stack and pushes a Vertex on the stack and mark it as visited in a Hash
  - Take a look at the vertex on the top of the stack
  - Take a look at all the adjacent unvisited vertices
  - Pick a adjacent unvisited vertices and push it into the stack and marked it as visited
  - Repeat until stack is empty

2. What supporting data structure might you use for BFS and DFS, respectively?
  - BFS (queue)
  - DFS (stack)

3. What are the steps for BFS on a graph?

  - Create a queue and insert the root into the queue
  - until the queue is empty
  - shift a element from the queue
  - push the shifted elements children into the queue
  - go on with the next iteration
