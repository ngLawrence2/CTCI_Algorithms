1. Give an example of a use-case for topological sort.

  - A use-case example for topological sort is dependency installation.
  - For example, a certain dependency requires another dependency and with many dependencies we need to install ones without any dependencies.

2. What is a difference between topological sort and DFS.

  -DFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching a graph or tree.
  - Topological sort is an algorithm where it sorts the vertices such that every directed edge uv from vertex U to vertex V, U comes before V.

3. On which types of graphs can we do topological sort.

  - directed

4. What data structure do we use to assist with the topological sort algorithm?

    -Queue
    
5. Explain the steps of topological sort.

  - Place all vertices that are independent into a queue
  - until the queue is empty
  - shift a vertex from the queue
  - check all adjacent vertices from the one shifted
  - delete the dependency of the shifted one at each adjacent vertices
  - if the adjacent vertices is independent after the deletion  insert into queue
  - repeat until queue is empty
