1. How do we define a graph mathematically?

  - A graph is an ordered pair of a set V of vertices and a set E of edges.

2. What is the difference between directed, undirected, weighted, and unweighted?

  - directed - where a edge has a direction
  - undirected - can go both ways between each vertices
  - weighted - each edge has a cost
  - unweighted - cost of each edge is the same

3. What makes a graph simple? What attributes make it not simple?

  - A graph is simple if it does not have self-loops or multiedges.
  - self-loops and multiedges make a graph not simple

4. What is the maximum number of edges in a directed simple graph? undirected simple graph?

  - directed - N(N-1) where N is the number of vertices
  - undirected - (N(N-1)) / 2 where N is the number of vertices

5. Describe the levels of connectivity a graph can have.

  

6. What are cycles?

7. What are some naive ways we can store and traverse graphs?
