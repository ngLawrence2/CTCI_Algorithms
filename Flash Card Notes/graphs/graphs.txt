1. How do we define a graph mathematically?

  - A graph is an ordered pair of a set V of vertices and a set E of edges.

2. What is the difference between directed, undirected, weighted, and unweighted?

  - directed - where a edge has a direction
  - undirected - can go both ways between each vertices
  - weighted - each edge has a cost
  - unweighted - cost of each edge is the same

3. What makes a graph simple? What attributes make it not simple?

  - A graph is simple if it does not have self-loops or multiedges.
  - self-loops and multiedges make a graph not simple

4. What is the maximum number of edges in a directed simple graph? undirected simple graph?

  - directed - N(N-1) where N is the number of vertices
  - undirected - (N(N-1)) / 2 where N is the number of vertices

5. Describe the levels of connectivity a graph can have.

  - Strongly connected - there is a path from any vertex to any other vertex
  - Weakly connected - there is not a path from a vertex to another vertex


6. What are cycles?

  - A path of edges and vertices wherein a vertex is reachable from itself

7. What are some naive ways we can store and traverse graphs?

  

8. Explain the different ways that graphs can be represented. What are the pros and cons of various ways of representing graphs?

  - Adjacency matrix - fast run time but takes up too much space
  - Adjacency list - fast run time and takes up little room. If using an array, we need to copy over if we create a new edge.
